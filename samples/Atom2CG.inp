#Lines starting with "#" are comments. Only "full line" comments are allowed!
#The format is simple. It will have 2 sections.
#
#The first section starts with a line that only contains the word "BEADS".
#after that, each line corresponds to a bead. In each line, the number for the bead is given (this is just to make it more readable for humans), and, after
# a space, the indexes of the atoms that will form that bead are given, separated by commas (and counting from 1!)
#I decided to use 1-based indexes to make it easier to prepare the files from the information PyMOL shows, which is 1-based.
#You can assign half an atom to a bead. It will be weighted by half when center of mass or everythin else is considered. You just put the number of the bead /2

#The second section starts with a line that only contains the word BONDS after that, each line is a bond between 2 beads (counting from 1) that needs to be parametrized.
#Each line contains the identifiers of 2 beads, separated by a comma

#we could be lazy and ask the use for the angles/dihedrals to parametrize. Maybe it is best to do that, at least for now, and later add a angle/dihedral guessing function if we
